# GC-3-workshop-Measurement-Invariance
Measurement invariance (MI) ensures that a construct is interpreted similarly across different populations (e.g., gender, age, culture). Without establishing MI, comparisons across groups may be invalid or misleading. This tutorial introduces the concepts, steps, and implementation of MI testing using [R/lavaan] with real-world examples.
